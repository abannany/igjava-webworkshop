== Testing

Javascript is a standardized programming language. The last version of javascript is 'ECMAScript 2016'.
There are a lot of frameworks that can be used to test the javascript code. There are two kind of test
frameworks. Unit test and e2e (end to end) test frameworks. With the first one a piece of code can be tested. 
With e2e testing a test can be performed from the users point of view. In the Javascript world there 
are a lot of test frameworks. The following is a snapshot of this test frameworks:

* QUnit
* MochaJs
* Jasmine

In this section we shall write a unit test with Jasmine. Normally we use Karma to runt the tests. But
in this section just Jasmine is used.
