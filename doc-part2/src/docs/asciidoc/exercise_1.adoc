==== Steps

. Perform the following commands

[source, bash]
----
 # Go to exercises/simple-jasmine-test
 cd exercises/simple-jasmine-test

 # Create a folder named spec
 mkdir spec
 cd spec

 # Create a file named CalculatorSpec.js
 touch CalculatorSpec.js
----
[start = 2]
. Add the following code snippet in the created file CalculatorSpec.js

[source, js]
----
describe("Calculator", function () {  # <1>
  describe("when addition is performed", function () {
    
    var calculator;

    beforeEach(function () { # <2>

    });

    it("should return 5 when 3 is added to 2", function () { # <3>
      expect(calculator.add(3, 2)).toEqual(5);
    });

    it("should return 20 when 10 is added to 10", function () { # <3>
      expect(calculator.add(10, 10)).toEqual(20);
    });
  });
});
----
----
<1> Here we define the test suite. The name of the suite is 'Calculator'.  
<2> Fixture setup. This step is performed for every test
<3> The test specs to test the scenario's

[start = 3]
. Open the file SpecRunner.html of the 'simple-jasmine-test' folder with your favorite text editor.
** The following shall be visible

[source, html]
